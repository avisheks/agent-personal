Detailed evaluation results are reported in this [📑 blog (Qwen3-2504)](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/) and this [📑 blog (Qwen3-2507) [coming soon]](/QwenLM/Qwen3/blob/main).

For requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results [here](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/speed_benchmark.html).

Transformers is a library of pretrained natural language processing for inference and training. The latest version of `transformers` is recommended and `transformers>=4.51.0` is required.

The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 to generate content based on given inputs.
    
    
    from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
    
    model_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507"
    
    # load the tokenizer and the model
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
        model_name,
        torch_dtype="auto",
        device_map="auto"
    )
    
    # prepare the model input
    prompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ]
    text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
        messages,
        tokenize=False,
        add_generation_prompt=True,
    )
    model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
    
    # conduct text completion
    generated_ids = model.generate(
        **model_inputs,
        max_new_tokens=16384
    )
    output_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() 
    
    content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
    
    print("content:", content)

Note

Qwen3-Instruct-2507 supports only non-thinking mode and does not generate `<think></think>` blocks in its output. Meanwhile, specifying `enable_thinking=False` is no longer required.

The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 to generate content based on given inputs.
    
    
    from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
    
    model_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"
    
    # load the tokenizer and the model
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
        model_name,
        torch_dtype="auto",
        device_map="auto"
    )
    
    # prepare the model input
    prompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ]
    text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
        messages,
        tokenize=False,
        add_generation_prompt=True,
    )
    model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
    
    # conduct text completion
    generated_ids = model.generate(
        **model_inputs,
        max_new_tokens=32768
    )
    output_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() 
    
    # parsing thinking content
    try:
        # rindex finding 151668 (</think>)
        index = len(output_ids) - output_ids[::-1].index(151668)
    except ValueError:
        index = 0
    
    thinking_content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[:index], skip_special_tokens=True).strip("\n")
    content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[index:], skip_special_tokens=True).strip("\n")
    
    print("thinking content:", thinking_content)  # no opening <think> tag
    print("content:", content)

Note

Qwen3-Thinking-2507 supports only thinking mode. Additionally, to enforce model thinking, the default chat template automatically includes `<think>`. Therefore, it is normal for the model's output to contain only `</think>` without an explicit opening `<think>` tag.

Qwen3-Thinking-2507 also features an increased thinking length. We strongly recommend its use in highly complex reasoning tasks with adequate maximum generation length.

**Switching Thinking/Non-thinking Modes for Previous Qwen3 Models**

By default, Qwen3 models will think before response. This could be controlled by 

  * `enable_thinking=False`: Passing `enable_thinking=False` to `tokenizer.apply_chat_template` will strictly prevent the model from generating thinking content.
  * `/think` and `/no_think` instructions: Use those words in the system or user message to signify whether Qwen3 should think. In multi-turn conversations, the latest instruction is followed.



We strongly advise users especially those in mainland China to use ModelScope. ModelScope adopts a Python API similar to Transformers. The CLI tool `modelscope download` can help you solve issues concerning downloading checkpoints. For vLLM and SGLang, the environment variable `VLLM_USE_MODELSCOPE=true` and `SGLANG_USE_MODELSCOPE=true` can be used respectively.

[`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) enables LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of hardware. `llama.cpp>=b5401` is recommended for the full support of Qwen3.

To use the CLI, run the following in a terminal:
    
    
    ./llama-cli -hf Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q8_0 --jinja --color -ngl 99 -fa -sm row --temp 0.6 --top-k 20 --top-p 0.95 --min-p 0 -c 40960 -n 32768 --no-context-shift
    # CTRL+C to exit

To use the API server, run the following in a terminal:
    
    
    ./llama-server -hf Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q8_0 --jinja --reasoning-format deepseek -ngl 99 -fa -sm row --temp 0.6 --top-k 20 --top-p 0.95 --min-p 0 -c 40960 -n 32768 --no-context-shift --port 8080

A simple web front end will be at `http://localhost:8080` and an OpenAI-compatible API will be at `http://localhost:8080/v1`.

For additional guides, please refer to [our documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_locally/llama.cpp.html).

Note

llama.cpp adopts "rotating context management" and infinite generation is made possible by evicting earlier tokens. It could configured by parameters and the commands above effectively disable it. For more details, please refer to [our documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_locally/llama.cpp.html#llama-cli).

After [installing Ollama](https://ollama.com/), you can initiate the Ollama service with the following command (Ollama v0.9.0 or higher is recommended):
    
    
    ollama serve
    # You need to keep this service running whenever you are using ollama

To pull a model checkpoint and run the model, use the `ollama run` command. You can specify a model size by adding a suffix to `qwen3`, such as `:8b` or `:30b-a3b`:
    
    
    ollama run qwen3:8b
    # Setting parameters, type "/set parameter num_ctx 40960" and "/set parameter num_predict 32768"
    # To exit, type "/bye" and press ENTER
    # For Qwen3-2504 models,
    # - To enable thinking, which is the default, type "/set think"
    # - To disable thinking, type "/set nothink"

You can also access the Ollama service via its OpenAI-compatible API. Please note that you need to (1) keep `ollama serve` running while using the API, and (2) execute `ollama run qwen3:8b` before utilizing this API to ensure that the model checkpoint is prepared. The API is at `http://localhost:11434/v1/` by default.

For additional details, please visit [ollama.ai](https://ollama.com/).

Note

Ollama's naming may not be consistent with the Qwen's original naming. For example, `qwen3:30b-a3b` in Ollama points to `qwen3:30b-a3b-thinking-2507-q4_K_M` as of August 2025. Please check <https://ollama.com/library/qwen3/tags> before use.

Note

Ollama adopts the same "rotating context management" with llama.cpp. However, its default settings (`num_ctx` 2048 and `num_predict` -1), suggesting infinite generation with a 2048-token context, could lead to trouble for Qwen3 models. We recommend setting `num_ctx` and `num_predict` properly.

Qwen3 has already been supported by [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai/). You can directly use LMStudio with our GGUF files.

To export and run on ExecuTorch (iOS, Android, Mac, Linux, and more), please follow this [example](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/main/examples/models/qwen3/README.md).

To export and run on MNN, which supports Qwen3 on mobile devices, please visit [Alibaba MNN](https://github.com/alibaba/MNN).

If you are running on Apple Silicon, [`mlx-lm`](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm) also supports Qwen3 (`mlx-lm>=0.24.0`). Look for models ending with MLX on Hugging Face Hub.

If you are running on Intel CPU or GPU, [OpenVINO toolkit](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit) supports Qwen3. You can follow this [chatbot example](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/blob/latest/notebooks/llm-chatbot/llm-chatbot.ipynb).

Qwen3 is supported by multiple inference frameworks. Here we demonstrate the usage of `SGLang`, `vLLM` and `TensorRT-LLM`. You can also find Qwen3 models from various inference providers, e.g., [Alibaba Cloud Model Studio](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/product/modelstudio).

[SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) is a fast serving framework for large language models and vision language models. SGLang could be used to launch a server with OpenAI-compatible API service. `sglang>=0.4.6.post1` is required.

For Qwen3-Instruct-2507,
    
    
    python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 --port 30000 --context-length 262144

For Qwen3-Thinking-2507,
    
    
    python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 --port 30000 --context-length 262144 --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1

For Qwen3, it is
    
    
    python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-8B --port 30000 --context-length 131072 --reasoning-parser qwen3

An OpenAI-compatible API will be available at `http://localhost:30000/v1`.

Note

Due to the preprocessing of API requests in SGLang, which drops all `reasoning_content` fields, the quality of **multi-step tool use with Qwen3 thinking models** may be suboptimal, which requires the existence of the related thinking content. While the fixes are being worked on, as a workdaround, we recommend passing the content as it is, without extracting thinking content, and the chat template will correctly handle the processing.

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. `vllm>=0.9.0` is recommended.

For Qwen3-Instruct-2507,
    
    
    vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 --port 8000 --max-model-len 262144

For Qwen3-Thinking-2507,
    
    
    vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 --port 8000 --max-model-len 262144 --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1

For Qwen3, it is
    
    
    vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-8B --port 8000 --max-model-len 131072 --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser qwen3

An OpenAI-compatible API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/v1`.

Note

Due to the preprocessing of API requests in vLLM, which drops all `reasoning_content` fields, the quality of **multi-step tool use with Qwen3 thinking models** may be suboptimal, which requires the existence of the related thinking content. While the fixes are being worked on, as a workdaround, we recommend passing the content as it is, without extracting thinking content, and the chat template will correctly handle the processing.

[TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) is an open-source LLM inference engine from NVIDIA, which provides optimizations including custom attention kernels, quantization and more on NVIDIA GPUs. Qwen3 is supported in its re-architected [PyTorch backend](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/torch.html). `tensorrt_llm>=0.20.0rc3` is recommended. Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/examples/models/core/qwen/README.md#qwen3) page for more details.
    
    
    trtllm-serve Qwen/Qwen3-8B --host localhost --port 8000 --backend pytorch

An OpenAI-compatible API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/v1`.

For deployment on Ascend NPUs, please visit [Modelers](https://modelers.cn/) and search for Qwen3.

For tool use capabilities, we recommend taking a look at [Qwen-Agent](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent), which provides a wrapper around these APIs to support tool use or function calling with MCP support. Tool use with Qwen3 can also be conducted with SGLang, vLLM, Transformers, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc. Follow guides in our documentation to see how to enable the support.

We advise you to use training frameworks, including [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl), [UnSloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth), [Swift](https://github.com/modelscope/swift), [Llama-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory), etc., to finetune your models with SFT, DPO, GRPO, etc.
